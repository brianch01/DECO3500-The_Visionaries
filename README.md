****Project title** : Conversation mission deck**

**Description**

Our conversation mission deck is an innovative solution to enhance the group travel experience for young adults, especially for first-year UQ international students. Two problems we found within this demographic were the prevalence of conflicting preferences and the lack of communication between group members. As such, the conversation mission deck features providing question prompts and secret missions to engage group members in conversation and various fun activities. The prompts are designed to help with their decision making and manage their preferences whilst secret missions create fun memories, and valuable bonds and improve overall travelling experiences. 

**Technologies used**

The conversation mission deck consists of an Arduino Uno board, Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) screen and breadboard to manage external wiring and switches. Code for the device is uploaded from Arduino IDE.

**Requirements and Installation**
- Arduino IDE: The Code for this project is run in Arduino IDE, if you do not have it installed, download it here: https://www.arduino.cc/en/software
- You will need to have the LiquidCrystal library by Arduino to run the code. If this is not automatically downloaded, go to tools, manage llibrary and search “liquidcrystal” to download.
- Set up your Arduino and breadboard as shown in the image below:
